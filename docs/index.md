## Course Structure

<div class="course-overview">

### Part I: Getting Started

Start your journey with Arduino and eBricks-AI. Set up your workspace and write your first program.

### Part II: Foundations

Master digital and analog I/O, understand binary, and learn to read sensors.

### Part III: Output Devices

Create sound, music, and visual displays with buzzers and 7-segment displays.

### Part IV: Integration

Combine everything you've learned into complete projects and systems.

## Why This Course?

Traditional electronics courses make you spend **70% of your time fighting with hardware**. With eBricks-AI, you'll spend that time learning programming, AI, and IoT instead.

**Traditional Way:**

- Weeks learning to solder
- Hours debugging messy breadboards
- Guessing which unlabeled pin connects where
- Frustration before progress

**eBricks-AI Way:**

- Code on Day 1
- Clearly labeled connections eliminate guesswork
- Organized modules on LEGO-compatible bases
- Projects in Week 1
- IoT systems in Month 1
